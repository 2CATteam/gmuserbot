	"start": "Alright, we've decided to play a game! Since some of you may not have played before, here are the rules:\n\nEach round, there will be a secret word or phrase. Everyone will try to show the other players that they know what the secret phrase is, but one player - called \"The Chameleon\" - won't know what it is.\n\nThe goal for that player is to blend in with everyone else. The goal for the other players is twofold:\n\nOne, they need to identify who they think the Chameleon is.\nTwo, they need to convince everyone else that they are NOT the Chameleon, without giving the secret away to the Chameleon.\n\nNOW, with that out of the way, we're ready to start. To join in the game, type \"join\". Once everyone is in, someone type \"/start\".",

Have everyone say one or two things (Ideally single words or short phrases), then start accusing people by @-ing them. Once everyone has locked in their accusations, someone type \"/next\" to go on to the next round.\n\nPlease go in the following order: ",
